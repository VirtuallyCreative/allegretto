- Build with Accessability in mind, A.O.D.A (WCAG-2) "AA" Compliant
- Great for quick wireframing/prototyping
- A 12-Col grid that actually works
- Extend with your own CSS variables
- Comes with a handful of components & utilities
- Expects proper HTML5 semantic markup
- No CSS Pre-processers used, just vanilla CSS3

### CSS PreProcessor Support (LESS/SASS/STYLUS)

Allegretto is designed using the latest features of CSS-3. Staying true to the notions of *ease-of-use* and *minimalism*, it doesn't use any CSS pre-processor or overly-complex build process.
