Built for rapid wireframing / prototyping while keeping W.C.A.G. 2 design patterns in mind.

- Fast and lively. With Unpkg CDN goodness.
- Build with Accessability in mind; A.O.D.A / W.C.A.G.
- Great for quick wireframing/prototyping
- A simple 12-Col grid using flexbox
- Easy to extend with your own CSS variables
- Comes with a handful of components & utils
- Expects proper HTML5 semantic markup
- Normalize CSS reset baked in
- No Pre-Processer here, just vanilla CSS-3

## Get started

CDN:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/allegretto@latest/dist/retto.min.css">
```

npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install allegretto
```

```bash
yarn allegretto
```

### CSS PreProcessor Support (LESS/SASS/STYLUS)

Allegretto is designed using the latest features of CSS-3. Staying true to the notions of *ease-of-use* and
*minimalism*, it doesn't use any CSS pre-processor or overly-complex build process.
